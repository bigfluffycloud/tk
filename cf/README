This directory contains common configs, any settings of the same key
in the target configs will override this.

If you add features, run make genconf-bootstrap to extract
configuration defaults from the source tree. This
is an experimental addon that may fail on some code.

If so, please try to fix it and submit a brieff uniform diff.

If you can't, at least explain how to reproduce and report it.
Test it on another machine first if you can. Include platforms.

Thanks!
